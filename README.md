I built the same basic ReactJS counter app, in different methods.

1 - using **class** components

2 - using **functional** components.

3 - context with **class** components.

4 - context with **functional** components.

5 - context and reducers with **functional** components.

6 - redux with **class** components.

7 - redux with **functional** components.

of course such a basic app doesn't need context nor redux, but it's a good example for those who're still learning react like myself.
